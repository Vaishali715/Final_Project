# Final_Project
## Classify Mushrooms: Using Machine Learning Model

### Communication Protocols

Team members will communicate through Slack and Zoom meetings:
* On a daily basis, Slack will be used to convey any information and useful links for the project
* Alternate day, Zoom meetings will be scheduled to discuss the status of project by each team member and clarify the doubts if any

As per the protocols, the team members followed the following:
    The first meeting was a Zoom session in which the team members were introduced to each other and then discussed about the requirements of the project.

    The process of finalizing the project needs a lot of search and then shortlisting the topics and then arriving at a consensus for a topic. Every team member played their part of searching the topics and conveyed the shorlisted links through Slack in a common group. The topics were crosschecked and then 'Mushrooms' topic was finalized.

    As per the roles each team member worked and daily conveyed the information through Slack and discussed the status of the project as well as clarified each others' doubts over Zoom meetings whenever required.
