# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis 
Pandas (python) will be used to clean the data and perform exploratory analysis. 

## Database Storage and Connection
We will upload our csv data file into a postgres SQL database. We will create the schema for this file. We will create a database connection using sqlalchemy (python) in order to import the data from a postgres SQL database to a Jupyter Notebook for analysis.  

## Machine Learning 
sklearn (python) is a machine learning library we will use in order to split the data and preprocess the data. We will use the tensorflow (python) library for deep learning capabilities, to create and run our deep neurel network model.
